	You stand in an ornate room, at one point it would've been a pretty
swell place. Unfortunately, the current vermin population has redecorated 
since then. Their choice of paints look pretty tacky. Atop a large wardrobe,
you can make out the glint of something shiny. Perhaps a KEY? Behind you
is the doorway to the HALLWAY. To the far side of the room, you can see
a MASTER BATH.
