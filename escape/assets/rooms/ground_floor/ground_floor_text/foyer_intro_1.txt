	You stand in a large foyer. At one point it probbaly would've looked
pretty sick. Now it looks like something a realestate agent would call a 
"fixer-upper". Ahead is the front DOOR of the house. To the left appears to
lead to a DEN. Behind and to your left is a CLOSET. To your right is a 
doorway to a DINING ROOM. To your right and rear is a door labeled CELLAR.
Directly behind you is a STAIRCASE that leads upstairs.
