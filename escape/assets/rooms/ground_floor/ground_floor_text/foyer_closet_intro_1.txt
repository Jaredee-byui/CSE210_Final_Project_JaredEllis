	You appear to be in the strangest closet you've ever had the chance
to be inside of. You're not sure whats stranger, the overwhelming desire you
felt to walk into a strange closet, the large piles of UMBRELLAs with a note
that reads "Take one", or the man in distress standing in the closet. He seems
to be rapping about being in a closet. The EXIT to the foyer is behind you.
