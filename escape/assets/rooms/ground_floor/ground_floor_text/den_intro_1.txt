	You stand in a room that is clearly decorated as a den, give or take
a few decades. A large fireplace stands empty in the far corner. A coffee
table occupies the center of the room, flanked by some couches occupied by
some mildew. Upon the coffee table rests a BOOK in passable condition. The
EXIT to the foyer is behind you.
