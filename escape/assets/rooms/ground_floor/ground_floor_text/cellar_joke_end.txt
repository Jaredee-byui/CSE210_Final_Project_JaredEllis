	Sudddenly, you notice a strange crack in the corner. Cautiously,
you approach the crack and realize it's actually a secret door! Mustering
your strength you push the door in with a mighty blow. Beyond this doorway,
you see a strange control room filled with monitors, knobs, and all other 
manner of electronics. A large computer chair lies between you and the console,
obscuring the occupant of the chair. Carefully you approach the chair and fling
it around to face you! Shock sets in as you come face to face with the mysterious
entity that has been orchestrating this whole event. Finally you regain your
senses and can understand what it is you're looking at. It's none other
than a dog with orange fur and a white belly. A Shiba Inu! Overwhelmed,
you sink to your knees in defeat. The dog hops from the chair and licks your
face playfully. 

				Game Over.
