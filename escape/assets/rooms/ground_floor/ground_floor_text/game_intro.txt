	You awake laying on the floor in a room you don't recognize. You're
not sure how you got here, probably should've turned on the fans before you
started cleaning that spilled paint thinner. You won't make that mistake, again.
Climbing to your feet you realize you're in some sort of decrepit house,
perhaps the house everyone in town refers to as "the old abandoned house on
the hill over in the creepy part of town". Come to think of it, that's probably
exactly where you're at. All at once you feel a strange feeling come over you.
It seems you won't be leaving until you get to the bottom of what's going on
here!
