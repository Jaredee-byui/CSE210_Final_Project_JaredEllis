	The door to the cellar creaks open in a rather ominous way,
"spooky" it seems to say. Cautiously you walk down the stairscase before you.
Eventually, after seeming ages you arrive in the cellar. The very bricks in
the wall seem to hum with a strange energy. At least their harmony is pretty
good. Eventually, you come to the realization something is waiting there,
almost as if it's waiting for you to say something.
